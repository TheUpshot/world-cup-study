## Methodology of World Cup Study

The [study of public opinion about the World Cup](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/11/upshot/11up-cup.html) is based on 19,780 interviews conducted by YouGov in 19 countries between May 19 and June 2. YouGov conducted the interviews online, after selecting respondents from opt-in panels recruited by YouGov or its partners.

Internet penetration for these countries range from 37 percent in Mexico to 58 percent in Italy to 93 percent in the Netherlands, according to Internet World Statistics.

In countries with low Internet access, the samples were selected and the results weighted to reflect adult Internet users in terms of age, sex and some other country-specific variables. For countries with high access, the results are intended to reflect all adults in terms of age, gender, frequency of Internet usage and other variables.
